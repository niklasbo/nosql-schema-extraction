    # The second part of the algorithm, The Extractor
    # 1. To process the multilabel nodes we could have two approaches using sets theory:
    #       
    #           1: Use intersection, when the intersection of two multilabel nodes results
    #              in only one label we could then extract the properties and relationships
    #              that belong to that particular label
    #
    #           2: Use difference, and the same as the intersection with the difference
    #              between two multilabel nodes results in only one label
    #   
    #   But the intersection can be done with more than just two multilabel nodes because 
    #   its order does not matter and thats not true with difference
    #
    #   The difference also not works when there are multiple multilabels that have the same diff in
    #   the labels, e.g {'User', 'Person'}, {'Actor', 'Person'}, {'Director', 'Person'}
    #   two differences that result in User only
    #
    # 2. With intersection its simple, find multilabel nodes that intersect forming only one
    #    label, intersect the properties and the relationships of those multilabel too to form
    #    a new entry in the dictionary that has only one label (intersect_props_relationships method), 
    #    than extract this label and its relationships and properties from those multilabel 
    #    (process_intersection method) and reapeat this process until only one label nodes rest or we dont 
    #    have any other options to infer how those left multilabel ones could be split
